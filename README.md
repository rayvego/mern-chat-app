# MERN Chat App

A real-time full-stack Chat App made with MERN stack and socket.io focused more on backend than frontend.

Hosted using Render: https://mern-chat-app-m2m3.onrender.com/ (might take few minutes to load due to inactivity) 



## Introduction

My main motive to make this project was to learn the following new technologies - zustand, react (in depth), JWT, tailwindcss and socket.io.
## New Lessons Learned

There are many things that I learnt by making this project, some of which I wanted to learn but had no idea from where I'd get the knowledge from.

- Separating out frontend / backend and how to develop them individually, enabling me to work as a separate backend developer if the need be.
- Implementing JWT method of authentication which is different from what I previously implemented using standard cookies. I absolutely loved how nothing is stored on the server side and all on the user's browser!
- Strengthened implementation of socket.io to create real-time messaging.
- How to use a state-manager for react like zustand and what advantages does it bring.
- Using daisy-ui along with tailwindcss flipped the CSS world for a developer struggling to center a div!


## Software Design

This project follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) software design pattern, an industry standard for full-stack applications promoting Separation of Concerns, Modularity, Reusability, Scalability, Testability, Parallel Development, Maintainability and Flexibility.
